# Classification-of-Areca-nuts-using-Image-Processing

This is a project done as part of my undergraduate degree. 
Our project team developed a prototype for classification of arecanuts based on texture features. 
A Gabor response cooccurrence matrix (GRCM) is constructed analogous to Gray Level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). 
Classification is done using LBP algorithm and classifier based on GRCM features. There are twelve Gabor filters are designed (Four orientations and three scaling) to capture variations in lighting conditions. 
The LBP operator is a powerful means of micro texture description that has been used in texture analysis of arecanut. The Gabor filters and GLCM will capture data with different scale and angle. 
The LBP based Gabor and GLCM features have been used for classification of arecanut. LBP is applied on arecanut image then Gabor filters and GLCM have been applied on LBP image. 
The images are normalized to 300x300 sizes in order to improve the processing time. The results are compared and discussed exhaustively with Histogram correlation, GLCM, Gabor and combined (Gabor-GLCM) features.
